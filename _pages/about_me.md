## Bio

I am a Master's student under the guidance of Professor [Jun Zhao](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=HljRttwAAAAJ) at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://ia.cas.cn/). My current research interests include Large Language Model-based Agent, Tool Learning, and Information Extraction.

Prior to pursuing my master's degree, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering and a Bachelor of Economics from [Hunan Normal University](https://www.hunnu.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate studies, under the guidance of Associate Professor [Daojian Zeng](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=c1wQ9_kAAAAJ), I primarily focused on research in continual few-shot relation extraction and tool learning data generation.
